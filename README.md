# Simple setup of i3-gaps, bumblebee, conky and zsh

Install the main files programs first, ie i3-gaps, oh-my-zsh etc..
These are just config files.
All these files should go in $HOME, on a default setup.

This is where I setup everything from;

powerlevel9k for oh-my-zsh - https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k

bumblebee status - https://github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status

i3-gaps - https://github.com/Airblader/i3
